# Trajectory-Planning-of-Robotic-Arm-
Trajectory planning was performed on MATLAB for effective robotic arm motion planning. ROS was used to send commands to the motors to actuate. 

In code just edit your ROS IP's and send your motor commands to arduino which is further connected to jetson. You can use any ros topic (std_msgs/Float32MultiArray or std_msgs/Int32) for sending motor commands.
